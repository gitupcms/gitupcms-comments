# Gitupcms

Self-hosted comments for any website. Add one script tag to your pages and visitors can comment, reply, like
and mention each other after signing in with Google or GitHub. You moderate from your own admin panel, and the
comments stay in a SQLite file on your server.

- Threads per page, replies, likes, @mentions
- Moderation: pending / approved / spam, bans, a log of every action
- Email notifications (your SMTP server), unsubscribe links
- Light/dark theme, your color and corner radius
- Export everything as JSON, or delete it all

## Run it

Needs Node 22+. From npm, in a folder with your `.env` (see `.env.example`; the database goes in `data/`):

```sh
npx @gitupcms/comments   # HOST and PORT pick the address (default localhost:4321)
```

Or from source, with pnpm:

```sh
cp .env.example .env    # set BETTER_AUTH_URL and BETTER_AUTH_SECRET at least
pnpm install
pnpm build
node --env-file=.env dist/server/entry.mjs   # HOST and PORT pick the address (default localhost:4321)
```

Or with Docker:

```sh
docker build -t gitupcms .
docker run -d -p 4321:4321 -v gitupcms-data:/data --env-file .env gitupcms
```

Put it behind HTTPS (Caddy, nginx…) at the address in `BETTER_AUTH_URL`.

Open the address. The first account you create (email and password, or GitHub when `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is
set) is the admin; after that only invited people can sign up. Invite more admins from **Team**: they get an
email (when SMTP is set) and a link that works for a week. Back up the database file (`DB_PATH`, default
`data/gitupcms.db`).

Behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY=1` so sign-in rate limits see visitors' addresses (`X-Forwarded-For`).
Only set it when the proxy overwrites that header.

## Add comments to a site

1. **Add site**: give it a name and its domain. Comments are only accepted from that domain and the origins
   in Settings.
2. **Settings → Sign-in**: add a Google or GitHub OAuth app for commenters, or set the `COMMENTS_*` variables
   in `.env` for every site.
3. **Install**: paste the snippet into your pages:

   ```html
   <div data-gitupcms-comments data-site-key="YOUR_KEY"></div>
   <script async src="https://comments.example.com/comments/embed.js"></script>
   ```

   Astro sites can use the component shown in the Install tab instead.

## Code

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/plugins/comments/` | The comments: widget, its API, commenter sign-in, admin panel, emails |
| `src/pages/` | Admin sign-in, the sites list, a site's admin page and their API |
| `src/lib/admin.ts` | Admin sign-in (better-auth: email + password, GitHub) |
| `src/lib/team.ts` | Admin invites and removing admins |
| `src/lib/db.ts` | The SQLite database |

`src/plugins/comments/` is also the comments plugin of WuppyCMS, which copies it from this repository unchanged
and only restyles it. So fix and build the comments here.

```sh
pnpm dev     # http://localhost:4321
pnpm check   # types
pnpm test
```
